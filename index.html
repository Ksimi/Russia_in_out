<h1 id="border-crossings-with-russian-federation">Border crossings with Russian Federation</h1>
<p><strong><a href="https://ksimi.shinyapps.io/Russia_In_Out/">&quot;Russia_in_out&quot;</a></strong> is the Shiny app based on the dataset of the border crossings with Russia for the period of <strong>2010 through 2019</strong>.</p>
<p>The official source of these quarterly updated data is the Border Service of the Russian Federation (see the data for <a href="https://fedstat.ru/indicator/38479">incoming</a> and <a href="https://fedstat.ru/indicator/38479">outgoing</a> traffic).</p>
<p>The dataset contains 40 quarterly observations of the border crossings with Russia with the traffic type additionally split into air, car, rail, ship and walk subsets.</p>
<p>The app code is written in <strong><a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a></strong> using the <strong><a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a></strong> package with some CSS fine-tuning.</p>
<p>The app utilizes the power of the <strong><a href="http://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/index.html">Shinydashboard</a></strong> and is organized into <strong>two different dashboard types</strong>:</p>
<h2 id="-great-circles-dashboard-"><strong>Great Circles dashboard</strong></h2>

<p>_The Great Circles dashboard map based on the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance">great-circle distances</a> and is showing the border crossings with Russia as the great-circle sections* on the World map utilizing the <a href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> library._</p>
<h6 id="_-the-starting-for-outgoing-or-ending-for-incoming-points-for-the-great-circle-sections-are-placed-in-the-russian-capital-moscow-this-geographical-simplification-was-made-due-to-the-facts-that-a-no-regional-split-of-the-russian-border-crossings-is-openly-available-yet-as-of-sep-2020-b-on-average-more-than-50-of-all-incoming-outgoing-air-traffic-finishes-in-originates-from-moscow-_"><em>*The starting (for outgoing) or ending (for incoming) points for the great-circle sections are placed in the Russian capital, Moscow. This geographical simplification was made due to the facts that: a) No regional split of the Russian border crossings is openly available yet (as of Sep 2020); b) On average more than 50% of all incoming/outgoing air traffic finishes in/originates from Moscow.</em></h6>
<p>The Great Circles dashboard menu allows a user to select the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of border crossing (into Russia, into Russia by population, out of Russia, crossing balance)</li>
<li>Number of top countries for showing on the map/populating the top countries list</li>
<li>Date in quarterly increments</li>
<li>Map view with some pre-selected layers from the <a href="http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html">map provider list for Leaflet</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The map and the great circles are <strong>interactive on hover</strong> and show the detailed crossing stats per country.</p>
<p>The Great Circles dashboard also shows the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Total border crossings + line chart</li>
<li>YOY change in border crossings + bar chart</li>
<li>RUB/EUR currency exchange rate + line chart</li>
<li>YOY change in FX rate + bar chart</li>
<li>Top countries list</li>
</ul>
<p>A user can also start an animated sequence of quarterly views when a “play” button on the date selection is clicked.</p>
<h2 id="mini-pie-charts-dashboard">Mini Pie Charts dashboard</h2>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ksimi/Russia_in_out/blob/master/data-raw/mini_chart.png" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>The Mini Pie Charts dashboard is using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet.minicharts/vignettes/introduction.html">leaflet.minicharts</a> package for showing the pie charts with the traffic type split by country on the World map.</p>
<p>The Mini Pie Chars dashboard menu allows a user to select the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of border crossing (into Russia, out of Russia)</li>
<li>Pie chart mode (total and by transport type with multi-selection possible)</li>
<li>Transport type (multi-selection possible)</li>
<li>Pie chart sizes</li>
<li>Map view with some pre-selected layers from the <a href="http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/index.html">map provider list for Leaflet</a></li>
<li>Date in quarterly increments (with the date controls on the map itself)</li>
</ul>
<p>The mini pie charts on the map are <strong>interactive on click</strong> and show the detailed traffic type stats per country.</p>
<p>A user can also start an animated sequence of quarterly pie chart views when a “play” button on the map is clicked.</p>
